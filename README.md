# Oblivion Remaster Companion

**ES4 Console Automation Tool**

---

### Project Overview

> I have zero knowledge in modding any Bethesda titles or modifying any UE5 games.  
> I wanted a simple console automation tool that can live independently from directly messing with the game files.  
> This is purely for fun.
